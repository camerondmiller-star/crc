Cloud Resume ChallengeThis project documents my end-to-end process of building and deploying a production-grade personal resume website on Google Cloud, leveraging AI as a copilot. The entire process was completed in approximately 5 hours over three days.Cloud Resume ArchitectureThis diagram illustrates the secure, scalable, and globally available deployment I built for cloudresume.thecammiller.com.

Key Architectural DecisionsSubdomain Isolation: 
Using cloudresume.thecammiller.com keeps my project isolated from my main WordPress site, a standard enterprise practice that avoids routing complexity and risk.Global HTTPS Load Balancer: This provides critical services like SSL termination, a global anycast IP, and a Google-managed certificate. It's the foundation for any production web service.Cloud CDN at the Edge: Enabled with a single checkbox, Cloud CDN caches my static assets at Google's global network edge, delivering real performance gains and reducing latency for users worldwide.

Built-in Observability: I enabled Cloud Logging from the start to gain crucial visibility into traffic, cache efficiency, and troubleshooting.Strategic AI Usage: I used AI to accelerate boilerplate tasks like drafting the initial HTML, but I owned all architectural decisions, trade-offs, and troubleshooting.Bumps in the RoadNo project is perfect. I used a systematic approach to diagnose and fix these issues:Bucket Returned XML: Instead of serving index.html, my GCS bucket showed an XML directory listing. The Fix: I enabled "Static website hosting" on the bucket, which told it to serve index.html as the default page.

SSL Certificate Stuck in "Provisioning": The Google-managed certificate wouldn't activate. The Fix: I knew this was expected until DNS was pointed correctly. After delegating the subdomain and adding the A record, I waited for DNS propagation, and the certificate activated automatically.

What This Project Demonstrates
This project is a tangible portfolio piece that showcases my ability to:
Design like an architect: I didn't just upload a file; I built a secure, scalable, and observable deployment.
Move fast with AI without outsourcing understanding: I can explain every component and every decision I made.
Troubleshoot systematically: I was able to reproduce, diagnose, fix, and verify solutions using both UI and CLI tools.
